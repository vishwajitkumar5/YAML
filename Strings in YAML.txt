Strings in YAML
==========================================================================================
1) Strings in YAML doesn't need explicit double or single quotes.

2) Use single or double quotes in YAML if your value includes special characters. For example, these special characters may require quotes: {, },[,], ,, &,:,*,#,?,|.-,<.>,=,!,%,@,\.

3) "Yes" and"No" should be enclosed in quotes(single or double)or else they will be interpreted as True and False boolean values.

4) we can use > (Folded style) to removes new lines within the string

5) we can use | (literal style) to turn every new line within the string into a literal newline.

6) you can contrl the handling of the final new line in the string, and any trailing blank lines (\n\n) by adding a block chomping indicator character:
   
    (i) >, |:"clip": keep the line feed, remove the trailing blank lines.
	(ii) >-,|-:"strip": remove the line feed, remove the trailing blank lines.
	(iii) >+,|+:"keep": keep the line feed, keep trailing blank lines.
